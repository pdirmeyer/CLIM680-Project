# The relationship between ENSO and temperature and preciptiation patterns 
 
## Kathy Pegion

## Introduction

My CLIM 680 project investigates the relationship between the El Nino Southern Oscillation and temperature and precipitation.  I choose this topic because it has been widely explored and written about in the scientific literature, but I wanted to see these relationships for myself.  I also explored the relationship between temperature and precipitation with another climate index, the NAO, for comparison.

## Data

The datasets used in my project are:

__NOAA/OISST__
The [NOAA/OISST](https://kpegion.github.io/COLA-DATASETS-CATALOG/sst.mnmean.nc) dataset is monthly, global sea surface temperature data from Dec, 1981 to Apr, 2020. It has horizontal resoluiton of 1deg longitude by 1deg latitude.
 
__GPCP Precipitation__
The [GPCP precipitation](https://kpegion.github.io/COLA-DATASETS-CATALOG/gpcp_precip.mon.mean.nc) is monthly global precipitation from Jan 1979 to Apr 2020. It is on a 2.5 deg longitude by 2.5 deg latitude gride.

__GHCN_CAMS__
The [GHCN_CAMS](https://kpegion.github.io/COLA-DATASETS-CATALOG/ghcn_cams) is a global, land-only, monthly temperature datasets from Jan 1948 to Mar 2020.  It is on a 0.5 deg longitude by 0.5 deg latitude grid.

__NAO Index__
The [NAO Index](https://www.psl.noaa.gov/data/correlation/nao.data) is the monthly CPC index, provided by NOAA/ESRL/PSL. It is located on the COLA servers in `/shared/ccsm4/kpegion/obs2/CLIM_INDICES/nao.data`. 

## Results and Codes

### Functions
I created a set of functions in `clim_utils.py` for doing common tasks used throughout my analysis, including:
* Labelling plots
* calculating climatology and anomalies
* etc.


### Conda Environment

The environment.yml file is provided to define the environment needed to run all codes.

### Figures

The figures from my notebooks are saved in the `figs` subdirectory and shown in my notebooks.
